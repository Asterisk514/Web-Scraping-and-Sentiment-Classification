# Web Scraping and Sentiment Classification of Financial News Articles

## Overview

This project focuses on extracting relevant news articles from financial websites and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of these articles. The goal is to automatically analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of financial news to aid decision-making processes in investment and trading.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automated extraction of news articles from financial websites using web scraping techniques.
  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for sentiment analysis, including tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.

- **Sentiment Classification**: Utilizing machine learning or deep learning models to classify the sentiment of each article:
  - Positive sentiment: News that suggests favorable outcomes for stocks, markets, or economies.
  - Negative sentiment: News indicating adverse impacts on stocks, markets, or economies.
  - Neutral sentiment: News that does not strongly sway sentiment in either direction.

- **Visualization**: Visual representation of sentiment trends over time using graphs or charts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Python library for web scraping.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Library for NLP tasks such as text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building classification models.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for advanced sentiment analysis models (optional).
